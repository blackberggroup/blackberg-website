## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure with source files in the `src` directory and production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

- `src`: Contains all the source files
- `app`: Contains all Next.js files inlcuding components, APIs, and assets
- `pages`: Contains all pages, utilizng Next.js router

## Development Setup

To set up the project for development, you'll need Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then follow these steps:

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Hygraph

To load data from Hygraph you will need to setup a .env.local file in the root directory. This is not stored in the repository for security purposes. Once you create the file add these two keys and get the values by logging into your Hygraph project. You can set the HYGRAPH_STAGE to either DRAFT or PRODUCTION. DRAFT will return unpublished content. 

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=""
HYGRAPH_TOKEN=""
HYGRAPH_STAGE=""
```

## SendGrid

To handle contact form and resume submissions you will need to setup a .env.local file in the root directory. This is not stored in the repository for security purposes. Once you create the file add these three items and get the API key by logging into your SendGrid account. The FROM_EMAIL needs to use the verified SendGrid email address. The TO_EMAIL is used for contact form submissions and the TO_EMAIL_CAREERS is used for resume form submissions.

### Environment Variables

```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=""
TO_EMAIL=""
TO_EMAIL_CAREERS=""
FROM_EMAIL=""
```

### Spam Prevention

All forms include a hidden input field to block spam submissions. Itâ€™s visually hidden and inaccessible to users, including those using assistive technologies, ensuring only bots interact with it.

## Deploy 

The project is setup to deploy on Vercel. The key/values in the .env.local file need to be added to the Vercel deployment configuration to work properly. 

CI/CD is utilized with GitHub actions. The website is built and deployed on every push to the main branch.
